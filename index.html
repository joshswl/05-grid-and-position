                <p class="content__bottom-text">From the last four assignments, I have learned a substantial amount of information regarding the foundations of building a website and/or application. The past week was filled with many accomplishments which were rooted from an extreme sense of being overwhelmed by the workload and confusion. I have learned how to deal with problems while having limited knowledge to these languages. This has taught me not only skills, but also, values which I can apply to any other problem. When a situation seems impossible, one should take it as an opportunity to grow. This type of growth has the potential to be much more effective and efficient than most other methods I have encountered. The reason may be that the problem solver becomes accustomed to failure. Therefore, I have come to realize that we as programmers carry value in our workplace because we have the ability to never reach complete blocks when debugging. As there are always ways to fix code, and ways to fix all other problems.</p>
